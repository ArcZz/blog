## Self-introduction
<!-- ## <font color=#079669>About</font> -->

I am a driven, hard-working individual with an interest in work that allows me to find creative solution to problems. I will complete my master’s degree in computer science from NYU this spring and I have a bachelor’s degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia, also in computer science.


My primary interest in Computer Science was ignited when I took a computer class in high school. By learning how to develop a desktop calculator with VB language, it astonished me that the commonly-used software was developed by a series of codes. Out of great curiosity, I chose Software Engineering as my undergraduate major, which led me to step into the threshold of Computer Science.

I am Zhi Zhang, a prospective Ph.D. student interested in Computational Biology. I have gained my master’s degree in Computer Science from New York University. And I have finished my undergraduate study at University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) and Taiyuan University of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering. I am now planning to pursue my Ph.D. degree in the USA, and excitedly find that your research on biology and medical science really inspires me.
