## Academic Projects

### NYC Coronavirus Data Analysis
Project Link: https://arczz.github.io/Nyc_Cov19_project/
- Tracked the current COVID-19 pandemic spread in NYC across the boroughs and zip codes using Spark,
analyzed the relations between pandemic spread and its influential factors including age, income, and traffic by
Spark Machine Learning

### Amateur Radio Direction Finding (ARDF) Simulation
Capstone Project in University of missouri - Columbia
<ul>
    <li>Collaborated with other teammates in building a radio sport Virtual Simulation for athletic training using
Unity3D and implemented multiplayer feature using Socket</li>
    <li>Customized and designed the UI interface and Head-up Display (HUD) of the simulation, and implemented
game save and load features using MySQL for users to record their progress</li>
</ul>

## Digital Biology Lab Project

### Plant Protein Phosphorylation Database Project, Digital Biology Lab
Project Link: http://www.p3db.org

- Participated in building a web resource portal for providing and analyzing protein phosphorylation data in
plants for 45 species from ~260 in-vivo proteomic studies using Angular and MySQL
- Built protein sequence conservation analysis tools for inferring the importance of residues in a protein


### G2S (Genome to Structure) Web Service
Project Link: https://g2s.genomenexus.org/

- Participated in building RESTful Web Service to analyze the 3D structure of proteins by Java Spring and
Maven, and generated API client libraries using Swagger for scientific computing
- Achieved the function of aligning users input protein sequence against the PDB sequences in the up-to-date
database employing BLAST algorithm
